FractalZoo - fractal visualization
==================================

Currently in early development stage. Not released anywhere yet and not prepared for release.

# Motivation
When I was reading release notes for some other fractal visualization app, there was something like "Speeded the app enormously by using native code". This looked a bit amateurish to me. Then I learned that basic GLSL that just displays a rectangle is actually quite easy. And we should all have an app to chill out and have fun.

# Roadmap
The goal is unsurprisingly to eventually get the app to an usable state and release it somewhere. Primarily probably on [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/), because it is a shining beacon of openness in this bleak corporate world:-) Then Google Play and various other app stores, if it brings something positive.

Current development stage is pre-alpha, where bugs are common and nothing works properly. Progress to alpha stage is tracked by a [GitHub project](https://github.com/comodoro/FractalZoo/projects/1).
